Contributing
============

Feel free to make changes. When adding a new feature or improving the code base, please fork the repo, make the minimal changes necessary, run the test suite, then submit a pull request (PR).  

Tests
=====

Writing tests is A Good Thing. Before you submit your PR, write new tests if possible for your features, and run the test suite:

```
nosetests -v
```

and then submit. Travis CI will also build the code and run your test suite when you submit a PR. 

Style
=====

Please use [Google's Python docstring style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html) for comments.
